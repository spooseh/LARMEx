    "We also calculate the relative estimation error, $\\delta$, in the aforementioned cases as $\\delta_\\theta = |\\hat{\\theta}-\\theta|/|\\theta|$ in which $\\theta$ and $\\hat{\\theta}$ are the true and estimated parameters respectively with $(\\sigma^2,\\text{SNR})=(0.02,6)$. To avoid computational difficulties only random effects larger than $0.02$ are considered in these analyses. We also report only the coefficients present in a network representation, i.e., $\\beta^{ar}$, $\\beta^{e}$, $b^{ar}$ and $b^{e}$. This is to show that in a mixed effects model the prediction of random effects is not as reliable as fixed effects in terms of being able to recover the parameters varying over days in our case. The reason is that only the variance of random effects are present in the likelihood function and individual values are not estimated directly but only up to their variance. More precisely what one gets as the output of software packages like [MixedModels.jl](https://juliastats.org/MixedModels.jl/stable/) in Julia or [lme4](https://github.com/lme4/lme4) in R holds only for the expected values and should not be considered as single parameter estimations. In the following figure it is clearly seen that the median relative estimation error for random effects approaches to about $40\\%$ as the number of days grows and the change is minimal after 20 days. Whereas, for the fixed effects, the value is below $20\\%$ which indicates that with a reasonable amount of data one could hope for even better estimates for the fixed effects but this is still far from being optimal. The two separate solid and dashed lines correspond to the coefficients of the exogenous factors which have poor estimations compared to others."

    "We studied an extension of linear mixed-effects models by adding an autoregressive component to model the network representation of mental state which is suitable for intensive longitudinal data, the so-called ecological momentary assessments acquired by experience sampling methods. Specifically, we assumed the simplest possible network of two causally interacting mood nodes under the influence of external factors represented by a node acting on both moods in a contemporaneous fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "We showed briefly how this representation is mathematically formulated and detailed the implementation of such a model in Julia. The practical implementation of data generating process was shown by explicit codes which is available on a public repository under GitHub. We also provided exemplary code for performing a bootstrap analysis to construct confidence intervals for the estimations. The goal here was to calibrate the model through imulations by quantifying the estimation errors. Further work is needed to perform the calibration and validation using real data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Given that our target was building individualized networks, we based our study on a two-level model with daily observations nested in days for a specific respondent. Using simulated data, we constructed bootstrap confidence intervals for the fixed effect parameters and showed what one could expect from this model as more days are added to the observation. We argued that random effects are not directly estimated in this procedure and highlighted the difference between the relative estimation errors for fixed and random effects which showed that in a mixed model random effects are identified less precisely. Consequently, as the number of observations increases the gain in precision is very little. Therefore, in order to infer individual networks from ecological momentary assessments, one should build a two-level model with daily observations nested in days for a single respondent.\n",
    "\n",
    "We mainly considered one aspect of study design related to sample size and varied the number of observations per subject by adding more days. We also showed how sensitive such a model might be to the intensity of noise in data. However, the provided code could be modified to study other variants to these scenarios."
