    "Assuming intensive longitudinal data through **ecological momentary assessment**, we formalize the mathematical representation of such networks by exogenous linear autoregressive mixed-effects models such that the autoregressive coefficients represent the interactions and the external factors enter the model as exogenous covariates. We let every parameter in the model to have fixed and random components aiming at networks that are allowed to have variable structures over reasonable units of time like days or weeks depending on the study design. Given the fact that a rich theoretical and computational literature furnishes classic linear mixed-effects models, we transform the autoregressive formulation to a classical one and use the already developed methods and tools. Then assuming our model is the true data generating process, we simulate data using a predefined set of parameters and investigate the performance and feasibility of this approach in delivering reliable estimates for different choices of the number of observations and the intensity of noise."
